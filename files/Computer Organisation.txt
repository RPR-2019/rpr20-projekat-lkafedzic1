In Praise of Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/
Software Interface, Fifth Edition

Textbook selection is oft en a frustrating act of compromise—pedagogy, content
coverage, quality of exposition, level of rigor, cost. Computer Organization and
Design is the rare book that hits all the right notes across the board, without
compromise. It is not only the premier computer organization textbook, it is a
shining example of what all computer science textbooks could and should be.
